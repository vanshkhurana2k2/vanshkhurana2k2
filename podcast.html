  # A Sports Podcast?
  <p> Yes. A sports podcast. I've been really engrossed in basketball and football for the past two years, watching highlights, analytics,   and as many games as possible. After doing all this, I feel like I have developed my own opinions using my learned knowledge of      
  basketball and football. Starting a sports podcast is something I've been looking in to, since I enjoy deep debates with my friends and   family. However, the equipment needed to record a video podcast with multiple people requires a hefty sum of initial investment. In     
  order to begin a podcast with guests, multiple microphones and cameras are needed. More to come on this idea...
